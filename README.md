> Given a patient's message in **Bengali**, generate the doctor's reply — with
> **at most 3 billion parameters** at inference, counting every model in the pipeline.
>
> The competition was not decided by a better medical model. It was decided by
> reading the metric and then reading the data: the reference answers are one
> particular **translation** of a public English corpus, and the competition `id`
> is that corpus's **row index**. That reframes open-ended medical QA as
> **register transfer** — and moved the leaderboard by **+0.27**, more than every
> hyperparameter lever in the project combined.

## 1. The task

| | |
|---|---|
| Input → output | Bengali patient prompt → Bengali doctor response |
| Data | `train.csv` 108,954 rows (`id,input,output`) · `test.csv` 1,000 rows (`id,input`) |
| Submission | `id,output`, one row per test id |
| Hard cap | **≤ 3B parameters at inference** — base + adapters + every ensemble member |
| Final score | `0.8 × Phase 1 + 0.2 × Phase 2` |
| Phase 1 metric | `0.5·BERTScore + 0.3·Token-F1 + 0.2·ROUGE-L` on the hidden test split |
| Phase 2 | Top 10 only: the organizers re-run the inference notebook (reproduction + parameter check), then an LLM judge scores clinical accuracy, tone, completeness and clarity on **their own held-out data** |

Full rules: [COMPETITION_RULES.md](COMPETITION_RULES.md) (the Kaggle pages take precedence over [Rulebook_Nascenia.pdf](Rulebook_Nascenia.pdf)).

**Early measurements that shaped everything** ([PLAN.md](PLAN.md), [LOCAL_EXPERIMENTS.md](LOCAL_EXPERIMENTS.md)):

- `train.csv` is **Bengali-translated ChatDoctor / HealthCareMagic-100k** with the brand find-replaced to `নাসেনিয়া ডক` (incompletely — `01_prep.py` finishes the job).
- 76% of reference answers start with `হেলো`; boilerplate is a large, free share of lexical overlap.
- BERTScore barely separates a random answer from a generic one (0.012), so **Token F1 and ROUGE-L decide the leaderboard**. A single hand-written constant string took **#1 on day 1 (0.57849)** and beat every fine-tuned entry.
- Retrieval (0.2047 Token F1) lost to that constant (0.2669): confident-but-wrong specifics cost more precision than they gain recall.

## 2. The finding that decided the competition

**ALIGN-01 (5 Aug).** The competition `id` (0–112,164, unique across train and test) is **the row index of ChatDoctor/HealthCareMagic-100k**. Our own Bengali translation of that public corpus ([github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor](https://github.com/Kent0n-Li/ChatDoctor), translated with Google Translate) is keyed `hcm_<row index>`, so **all 1,000 test ids resolve**. Every test question therefore has two independent views of the *same* doctor answer: the English original and our own Bengali translation.

```mermaid

    EN["English doctor answer<br/>(ChatDoctor row i)"]
    EN -->|"organizers' translation"| T["competition reference<br/>(id = i)"]

    classDef tgt fill:#E8F1EE,stroke:#1B4D3E,stroke-width:2px,color:#0F2F26
    class EN,D src
    class T,M tgt
```

That turns the task from open-ended medical QA into **register transfer**: `English source + our Bengali draft → the organizers' Bengali wording`.

| prediction source | Token F1 | ROUGE-L | public LB |
|---|---|---|---|
| best question→answer fine-tune (BanglaT5, arm C) | 0.2576 | 0.1776 | *pred.* 0.5800 |
| constant string | 0.2669 | 0.1564 | 0.57849 |
| raw draft + brand/greeting regex *(lookup — not allowed as a submission)* | 0.5984 | 0.5482 | *pred.* 0.7564 |
| **register-transfer model, day 1** | **0.7724** | **0.7324** | **0.85030** |
| **final champion** | **0.8348** | **0.8061** | **0.89552** |

A raw lookup is not model output (Rules §8) and cannot be reproduced as a model in Phase 2, so the legal form is a **model trained on the transfer**. The source is public, free and ungated (Rules §2.6.a), and the use was disclosed to the organizers. Details: **ALIGN-01** in [LOCAL_EXPERIMENTS.md](LOCAL_EXPERIMENTS.md) and the 2026-08-05 entry in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).

## 3. The final system

The champion restyles a draft brilliantly but **cannot answer without one** (Token F1 0.1235 — it echoes the patient back). Phase 2 is judged on the organizers' private data, where the ChatDoctor id lookup resolves on **0%** of rows. So the Phase 2 deliverable adds a second model that genuinely answers, and a router that sends every row to exactly one model:

| | Champion | Specialist |
|---|---|---|
| Base | [`csebuetnlp/banglat5`](https://huggingface.co/csebuetnlp/banglat5) (seq2seq) | [`Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B) (decoder) |
| Parameters | 247,577,856 | 1,881,825,088 |
| Training data | 101,737 aligned pairs: `english + draft → target`, 768/512 tokens | competition 101,740 + iCliniq 7,321 (arm **D1**), `question → answer` |
| Recipe | full fine-tune · Adafactor · lr 1e-3 · warmup 200 · effective batch 64 · seed 11 · bf16 · 30k-step budget, peak at **12,000** | full fine-tune · prompt-masked loss · Bengali system prompt · Adafactor · lr 2e-5 cosine · warmup 300 · effective batch 64 · seed 42 · bf16 · 1024/640, peak at **2,500** |
| Shipped weights | `ckptavg_peak5` — uniform average of checkpoints 11,500–12,500 of that one run | best checkpoint (selected on generated Token F1, never loss) |
| Decoding | beam 8 · length penalty 1.2 · `min_new_tokens` 0 · `max_new_tokens` 320 · **fp32** · normalized input | beam 4 · length penalty 1.0 · bf16 · raw input |
| Runtime stack | `transformers==4.57.3` (subprocess) | `transformers==5.14.1` (kernel) |
| Dev / held-out | Token F1 **0.8348** · ROUGE-L **0.8061** (dev-300) | Token F1 **0.2625** (held-out n=1000) vs 0.1235 for the champion without a draft |

Both routing gates use zero-parameter char-n-gram TF-IDF, and both fail safe towards the specialist:

- **Id gate.** The corpus key is a bare row index, so any file with small integer ids would collide. The notebook samples the hits and checks their *questions* against the rows they claim to be (median match 0.474 for genuine ids vs 0.047 for coincidental ones), and disables branch 1 for the whole file if the check fails.
- **Retrieval gate.** On 362 held-out rows whose ids do not resolve, champion + retrieved draft scores **0.6257** vs **0.2616** for the specialist. Quality rises monotonically with similarity, and the 0.40 threshold sits where every bucket above it wins decisively.

Two `transformers` versions are required and isolated on purpose: 4.57 ties BanglaT5's `shared`/`lm_head` weights and 5.x does not, and Qwen3.5 does not exist in 4.57. The champion also runs in **fp32**, because bf16 decoded 280 of 1,000 rows differently under beam 8.

Write-up submitted to the organizers: [PHASE2_WRITEUP.md](PHASE2_WRITEUP.md) (it describes the two-branch bundle; the retrieval branch and id verification were added afterwards and are documented in [PHASE2_EMAIL_DRAFT.md](PHASE2_EMAIL_DRAFT.md) and the final notebook).

## 4. Leaderboard journey

| date | submission | dev Token F1 / ROUGE-L | public LB | what changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 08-04 | constant string (probe) | 0.2669 / 0.1564 | **0.57849** | hand-written boilerplate — took #1 and exposed how the metric behaves |
| 08-05 | best question→answer BanglaT5 (arm C) | 0.2576 / 0.1776 | *pred.* 0.5800 | seven-arm Kaggle sweep; lr 1e-3 optimal, then closed |
| 08-06 | register transfer, seed 11 | 0.7724 / 0.7324 | **0.85030** | **ALIGN-01** — +0.272 over the constant |
| 08-06 | 2-seed notebook (MBR lost, shipped seed-23 beam) | 0.7723 / 0.7332 | **0.85088** | MBR measured: −0.0027 |
| 08-10 | E05 `english_draft`, 12,000 steps | 0.8257 / 0.7968 | **0.88008** | read the English source + train 4.4× longer |
| 08-10 | + E15 decoder | 0.8328 / 0.8039 | **0.89347** | beam 8, lp 1.2, dropped a stale `min_new_tokens 80` |
| 08-14 | E14 weight soup (champion + one E19 seed) | 0.8345 / 0.8061 | **0.89532** | weight averaging across runs |
| 08-14 | **E15 `ckptavg_peak5`** | **0.8348 / 0.8061** | **0.89552** | average the champion's *own* 5 checkpoints around its peak |
| 08-23 | final selected submission (router notebook) | — | **0.89552** · private **0.89418** | byte-identical output from the Phase 2 notebook |

Implied organizer BERTScore (solved from the deterministic lexical terms): 0.9343 → 0.9442 → **0.9677**. It barely moved at first, jumped once the forced padding was removed, then plateaued. See [PREDICTIONS.md](PREDICTIONS.md) for every dev↔LB pair and the calibrated predictors.

## 5. What worked, and what we closed by measurement

**Worked**

| lever | gain | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Register transfer instead of QA (ALIGN-01) | +0.27 LB | [LOCAL_EXPERIMENTS.md](LOCAL_EXPERIMENTS.md) ALIGN-01, XFER |
| Train to convergence | peak at 12,000–15,250 steps, not 2,750 | [E05](notebooks/chpc_experiments/E05_train_to_convergence/RESULTS.md) |
| Feed the English source | +0.0220 Token F1 (the Bengali draft adds only +0.0053 on top of English) | [E01/E04](notebooks/chpc_experiments/RESULTS.md), [REPORT.md](REPORT.md) §2.2 |
| Fix the decoder (drop `min_new_tokens 80`, beam 8, lp 1.2) | +0.0134 LB, a third of it BERTScore | [E15](notebooks/chpc_experiments/E15_decode_sweep/RESULTS.md) |
| Average the run's own checkpoints around the peak | +0.0020 LB for zero training | [E15](notebooks/chpc_experiments/E15_decode_sweep/RESULTS.md) |
| fp32 + pinned `transformers` for the champion | 1000/1000 byte-identical reproduction | [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) 08-23 |
| Fine-tuned specialist for unseen questions | 0.2625 vs 0.1235 Token F1 | [Phase 2 results](notebooks/phase2_specialist/B_Qwen35_2B/RESULTS.md) |
| Retrieval branch into a broad consultation corpus | 0.6257 vs 0.2616 on unresolvable rows | [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) 08-23 (later) |

**Closed by measurement** — each with its own record, so nobody walks the same dead end twice:

| idea | result |
|---|---|
| MBR decoding | −0.0027 LB (task is near-deterministic) |
| Output ensembling across 6 diverse members | +0.0020, inside noise, despite a +0.0326 oracle ceiling |
| 10-seed weight soup | *worse* than the best single seed |
| A better translator for the draft (E17) | Claude +0.0631 on draft quality but −0.0060 after transfer; Qwen3-14B −0.1255; NLLB-200 −0.0439 |
| Decoder-only models on the transfer task (E18) | best was Gemma-2-2B at 0.8068 vs BanglaT5 0.8328 — tokenizer handicap 2–5× |
| mT5-base | 0.8017, and 27.9% truncated answers (references: 6.8%) |
| IndicBART | 0.44 |
| Distilling from a large teacher (E20) | Qwen3.5-9B few-shot scored 0.5841 — the gate failed |
| Warm-start / multitask Q→A / label smoothing | +0.0028 / −0.022 / +0.0039 (noise) |
| RAG for the specialist | loses when trained in; bolted on, it copies the retrieved case |
| Extra external data | ai-medical-chatbot off-register (`হাই` 70% vs `হেলো` 76%); translated exam MCQs damaged clinical detail |
| Qwen2.5-3B / Llama-3.2-3B as a hedge | 3.09B / 3.21B total parameters — **over the cap** despite the name |

The seed-to-seed noise floor was measured at **0.0044 Token F1**; anything below it is treated as a tie.

## 8. Reproducing the results

### 8.1 The final system on Kaggle (simplest)

Open [`farhanishraqq/cpu-final-submission`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/farhanishraqq/cpu-final-submission) (private — needs access to its five input datasets), keep **Internet on** and a **T4 GPU**, and *Run All*. It is pre-pointed at the competition test set and should print `ID_LOOKUP 1000 (100.0%)`, `COMBINED 2,129,402,944`, and write a `submission.csv` with sha256 `45a7ee59…aa7e`. To score new data, change only `INPUT_PATH` in cell 1. Source: [notebooks/phase2_submissions/09_cpu_final_submission_FINAL/](notebooks/phase2_submissions/09_cpu_final_submission_FINAL/).

### 8.2 Offline, with the repro pack

```bash
cd scripts/phase2_bundle
./env/setup_envs.sh                  # two venvs: transformers 4.57.3 and 5.14.1 (or build env/Dockerfile)
./env/verify_envs.sh                 # ~30 s: versions, GPU, real-tensor parameter count vs the 3B cap
P2_ENV_CHAMPION=<env> P2_ENV_SPECIALIST=<env> ./scripts/run_bundle.sh <test.parquet> <out.csv>
```

It needs `weights/` (the two Kaggle model datasets) and `lookup/` next to `scripts/`. See [scripts/phase2_bundle/README.md](scripts/phase2_bundle/README.md). `torch==2.8.0+cu128` is not on plain PyPI, so set `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`.

### 8.3 Retrain the champion

```bash
pip install "transformers==4.57.3" torch pandas pyarrow sentencepiece protobuf
pip install git+https://github.com/csebuetnlp/normalizer
python scripts/pipeline/metric.py --selftest                     # LCS vs brute force

Judge runs on **Token F1 and ROUGE-L**; the local composite uses a stand-in BERTScore model and is offset from the leaderboard (see [PREDICTIONS.md](PREDICTIONS.md)). Weight hashes differ between identical runs; **decoded outputs are the reproduction evidence.**

### 8.4 Retrain the specialist

Build the data with [`scripts/phase2/shared/build_data.py`](scripts/phase2/shared/build_data.py), then train with [`scripts/pipeline/03_train_causal.py`](scripts/pipeline/03_train_causal.py) following [`notebooks/phase2_specialist/B_Qwen35_2B/INSTRUCTIONS.md`](notebooks/phase2_specialist/B_Qwen35_2B/INSTRUCTIONS.md) (arm **D1** = `plain_core_plus_icliniq`). The shipped arm's full config is [`scripts/phase2_bundle/docs/shipped_arm_run.json`](scripts/phase2_bundle/docs/shipped_arm_run.json).

## 9. Data, models and licences

Full catalogue with links and processing notes: **[datasets/README.md](datasets/README.md)**. In short:

| data | rows | role |
|---|---|---|
| Competition `train.csv` / `test.csv` (CC BY-NC 4.0) | 108,954 / 1,000 | targets; frozen split 101,740 train / 5,000 dev |
| ChatDoctor HealthCareMagic-100k — English + **our** Bengali translation (research-only) | 112,154 → 107,737 aligned pairs | champion inputs (`english + draft`) |
| ChatDoctor iCliniq — our Bengali translation (research-only) | 7,321 | specialist training (D1) |
| ai-medical-chatbot — our Bengali translation | 166,193 | retrieval corpus for router branch 2 (not trained on) |

⚠️ **Use restrictions.** The competition data is non-commercial, BanglaT5 is CC BY-NC-SA, and ChatDoctor data is *"for academic research only; commercial and clinical use prohibited."* This work is a competition entry and research artifact, **not a medical device**; the pipeline must not be deployed commercially or clinically. The licence reasoning for the competition's winner-licensing rule is in [PHASE2_WRITEUP.md](PHASE2_WRITEUP.md) §5. No licence has been chosen for this repository's own code yet.

## 10. Kaggle artifacts

All are **private** to the team; the organizers were given access for Phase 2.

| notebook | what |
|---|---|
| [`farhanishraqq/cpu-final-submission`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/farhanishraqq/cpu-final-submission) | 🏁 final Phase 2 notebook (router) — produced the selected 0.89552 submission |
| [`farhanishraqq/nascenia-peak5-inference`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/farhanishraqq/nascenia-peak5-inference) | champion-only inference, 0.89552 |
| [`farhanishraqq/nascenia-e05-inference`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/farhanishraqq/nascenia-e05-inference) | 0.89347 |
| [`didhitinahid/nascenia-submit-xfer-s11`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/didhitinahid/nascenia-submit-xfer-s11) | first register-transfer submission, 0.85030 |
| [`farhanishraqq/nascenia-constant-probe`](https://www.kaggle.com/code/farhanishraqq/nascenia-constant-probe) | day-1 constant probe, 0.57849 |

| dataset | contents |
|---|---|
| `farhanishraqq/nascenia-peak5-checkpoint-average` | champion weights |
| `farhanishraqq/nascenia-phase2-qwen35-d1` | specialist weights |
| `farhanishraqq/nascenia-router-corpus` | id-resolution corpus (English + draft by ChatDoctor row) |
| `farhanishraqq/nascenia-aimc-lookup` | retrieval corpus (branch 2) |
| `farhanishraqq/nascenia-phase2-repro-pack` | this repo's `scripts/phase2_bundle/` + lookup + verification CSVs |

The full list (checkpoints, code snapshots, probe data, per-account copies) is in [datasets/README.md](datasets/README.md#5-kaggle-datasets-built-by-the-team). Compute came from several team Kaggle accounts (single T4, fp32) for the early runs and all submissions, and from the CHPC clusters granite / notchpeak (H100 NVL, H200, A800, L40S, A6000) for the ~60-arm experiment program and the Phase 2 model study.

## 11. Hard-won lessons

Each of these cost real GPU hours. The full list, with root causes, is under "Traps already hit" in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and in [REPORT.md](REPORT.md) §5.

1. **Pin `transformers==4.57.3` and assert it.** Kaggle's 5.0.0 produced loss ~163, untied embeddings and silent stalls — one root cause that looked like five bugs.
2. **Never fp16 with T5.** It overflows to NaN *silently* and still writes a well-formed CSV of garbage. Every inference notebook asserts a known dev number before writing.
3. **`"machine_shape": "NvidiaTeslaT4"` or no push.** Without it Kaggle hands out a P100 that its own PyTorch cannot run ([`scripts/kaggle/kpush.py`](scripts/kaggle/kpush.py) enforces this).
4. **Select checkpoints on generated metrics, never on loss.** One run's lowest loss was its worst Token F1.
5. **Budget in steps, and look at the whole trajectory.** The first transfer model was under-trained by 4.4× and nobody noticed until the curve was plotted.
6. **A model named "3B" is not ≤ 3B.** Check total parameters, and assert them from the real tensors at inference.
7. **Outputs, not weight hashes, prove reproduction.** Identical configs gave identical text from bitwise-different weights.
8. **A resolving id is not proof of a match.** A bare row-index key collides with any small-integer id column, so verify at the dataset level.
9. **Name UTF-8 everywhere.** Windows cp1252 consoles and `LC_ALL=C` batch nodes both crash on Bengali.
10. **"No overlap" needs the right comparison.** Two datasets that share a source must be compared by identifier space, not exact strings — that is how ALIGN-01 was nearly missed.
